## 🚀 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Version Control & Automation 
I covered essentials of local and remote development environments.
* **Bash Scripting:** Automating tasks and navigating the Linux file system.
* **Git:** Local version control, branching strategies, and best practices.
* **GitHub:** Remote collaboration, Pull Requests (PRs), and repository management.
* **Git Conflict Resolution:** Managing code overlaps in a collaborative environment.

### Phase 2: Full-Stack Web Development(Current)
A deep dive into Full-Stack web development:
* **Html, CSS:** Implementing automated workflows.
* **JS:** Js features and implementation.

# Day-wise Summary

## Day1(22nd Dec 2025)(Phase 1):
---
**What is done today:**
1. Environment Setup: Successfully configured Git Bash and linked it to GitHub repository (https://github.com/amitabhsingh64/BridgeLabz).<br>
2. Identity Correction: Performed an Interactive Rebase to manually review and fix author names across the entire commit history for a professional profile.<br>
3. Repository Synchronization: Resolved non-fast-forward errors and handled unrelated histories during a complex branch merge.<br>
4. CLI Proficiency: Learned terminal navigation (Vim, Pagers, mv commands) and understood the "Three-Stage" Git architecture (Working Directory vs. Staging vs. Repo).<br>
5. Documentation: Created a structured, professional README.md tailored for Apexon winter training.<br>
6. compared : Cherry-Pick vs rebase and merge<br>

**What I will do next:**

1. Bash Scripting Baics 

**Issue faced:**
1. Merge Conflicts: Resolved a (main|MERGING) block by aborting and correctly rebasing local changes.<br>
2. Identity Mismatch: Fixed the `<oldname>` vs. Amitabh Singh author name issue in the Git logs.<br>
3. Vim Swap Files: Successfully bypassed .swp file warnings to complete the merge process.<br><br>
## Day2(23rd Dec 2025):
**What is done today:**
1. Linux & WSL: Practiced essential Bash commands (ls, cd, mkdir, touch) within the WSL environment to manage project directories.<br>
2. Git Mastery: Resolved "unrelated histories" and "non-fast-forward" errors; practiced Interactive Rebasing and Vim navigation.<br>
3. JavaScript Logic: Developed a Counter App using DOM manipulation and event listeners; clarified let vs const .<br>
4. Documentation: Learned Markdown syntax for professional README.md files (headings, lists, and horizontal rules).<br>
**What I will do next:**
1. Advanced CSS: Style the counter UI using Flexbox and transitions.<br>
2. JS Persistence: Implement localStorage to save data across page refreshes.<br>
3. Bash Scripting: Automate simple tasks in WSL using basic shell scripts.<br>
**Is there any issue you faced:**
1. Vim/CLI Friction: Initial difficulty with Vim motions and terminal navigation, which improved with practice.<br>
2. Syncing Issues: Faced Git push rejections and capitalization mismatches between HTML IDs and JS.<br>
